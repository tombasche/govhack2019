Tapestry
=======

- Notebooks and cleaned data sets are in /data
- The Frontend code is in /frontend
- Backend code is in /backend

The UI is written with ReactJS, while the data cleaning and munging etc. was just done with Pandas/Numpy within a Jupyter notebook. The backend is a simple Python/Flask app which takes a set of x/y values and a metric and provides what a particular prediction will be like based on this trend.
